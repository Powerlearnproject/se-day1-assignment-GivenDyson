Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1.Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing and maintaining software.

reliability- it ensures software performs as expected without bias especially for critical applications like healthcare ,finance.

efficiency - it helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards.

 scalability and flexibility - it ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performance.


2.Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Mastering Complexity - Early software was simple, but as systems grew, modular programming and object-oriented programming (OOP) helped manage complexity, making code easier to maintain and scale.

Mastering Process - Software development evolved to include structured methods like the Waterfall Model and later more flexible approaches like Agile and DevOps, improving efficiency and adaptability in the development process.

Mastering Machine - With the rise of high-level languages and optimization techniques, engineers learned to harness the full power of hardware, while advancements in parallel computing and cloud technologies optimized software performance.

3.List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning - identify the software requirement or purpose and scope.

 requirement analysis - identify the final user specification.

design - building the framework.

coding - converting software design into tangible code.

 testing - examine the software for any bugs and glitches

4.Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology - Linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on.

- there is Low flexibility,

 changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.

 - Customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed.

 - Testing is done at the end of the development process.


agile methodology - Iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles (sprints).

- High flexibility, adapts to changing requirements.

- Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint.

- Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.


5.Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.

 - maintaining and updating software to keep it functional.

- collaborating with other team members to ensure best practice when developing software.

 - reporting to the project manager about the progress of the software development.

Quality Assurance Engineer - collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement.

 - create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow

 - confirm that the software meets the requirement before deployment.

- analyse the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make them more efficient.

- develop and execute automation scripts using open source tools.

Project Manager - assembles and lead the software development team.

 - discuss the project and it's requirement with the client and software developers.

 - create blueprint for the project.

 - tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.

 - deliver the complete software to the client and regularly check its performance.


6.Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) - IDEs combine coding, debugging, and testing tools into one interface, improving productivity and reducing errors. They provide features like code completion, syntax highlighting, and debugging tools. Examples: Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA.

Version Control Systems (VCS) - VCS track changes to code, enabling collaboration and history management. They allow multiple developers to work on the same project without overwriting each other's work. Examples: Git, Subversion (SVN).


7.What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Rapid Technological Advancement - Staying current with emerging trends can be overwhelming. Solution: Continuous learning and adopting agile methodologies to adapt quickly.

Time Constraints - Meeting tight deadlines can be stressful. Solution: Use agile methodologies like Scrum to break projects into manageable sprints.

Limited Infrastructure - Lack of high-performance tools and efficient data storage can hinder productivity. Solution: Rely on robust infrastructure to support development.

Changing Software Requirements - Frequent changes in requirements make design and development difficult. Solution: Adopt agile and modular design for flexibility and iterative progress.

Software Security - Ensuring secure software is complex. Solution: Research and implement defenses against hacking and other security threats.

Software Accessibility and Usability - Overly complex software can frustrate users. Solution: Focus on scalable architecture and emphasize reliability.


8.Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit tests - are close to the source of an application, They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. - it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.

 Integration tests - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.

 - help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.

 System testing -Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.

 -It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security .

Acceptance tests - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors.

- Whether the software meets the needs of the end-user and is ready for deployment.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


1.Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.

Importance
Improved user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language models’ training data.

Increased flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.

developer control - Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise.


2.Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: "Tell me about computers."

Improved Prompt: "Explain how a computer's CPU processes data and its role in overall system performance."

Why It's More Effective: The improved prompt is specific, focusing on the CPU’s function, which leads to a more targeted and informative response. It eliminates ambiguity and gives clear direction on what the user seeks.
